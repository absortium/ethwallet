# This file was generated by 'pip freeze' command in order to fixate state of the system
# this was done because sometimes, after recompilation of the docker container we run into the situation that
# system stops working, and we can't spend a lot of the time to investigate the problem, so if you need to update system than:
# 1. Delete ==<version>" prefixes
# 2. Leave only general libraries
# 3. Recompile the docker container
# 4. Insure that all working as it should
# 5. Generate list of the packages by 'pip freeze' command
# 6. Update requirements.txt
